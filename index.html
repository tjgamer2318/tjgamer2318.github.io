    <h1>It's everyday bro
With the Disney channel flow
Five mill on YouTube in 6 months
Never done before
Pass all the competition man
Pewdiepie is next
Man I'm poppin' all these checks
Got the brand new Rolex
And I met the Lambo too
And I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch
Who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out
If they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you
You beggin for attention
Talking shit on Twitter too
But you still hit my phone last night
It was 4: 52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too
Don't make me tell them the truth
And I just drop some new merch
And they're selling like a God church
Ohio is where I'm from
We chew'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun
The tattoo's just for fun
Ah you say boat and run
Catch me at game on
I cannot be outdone</h1>
